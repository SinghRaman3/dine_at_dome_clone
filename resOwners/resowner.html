                    <span>Hospitality industry has changed and restaurants as we known them aren’t coming back for a while.</span>
                    <p>Restaurateurs need to provide a safe environment for diners to comply with the new social distancing
                        regulations. Guests
                        need reassurance that it’s safe to eat out again.</p>

                <div>
                    <p>Restaurants are less busy and the owners need to find a way to minimise the costs and streamline their
